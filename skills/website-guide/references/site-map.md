| Browse programs | `/` | Directory with program search, category filters, pagination, and commission sorting. Guest and free previews are limited; existing PRO access expands the catalog and presets. |

| Latest additions | `/latest-affiliate-programs` | Public preview of recent programs. |

| Manage owned listings | `/my-programs` | Signed-in owner dashboard; verified company email required. Use only the current user's listings and requested actions. |
| Explain access | `/pricing` | Public information. Explain a relevant existing entitlement without displaying plan promotions, initiating subscriptions, or following checkout links. |

## Discovery and readable content

- `/llms.txt`: page and guide discovery plus a partial set of featured/recent public programs. The current generator limits program entries to 30. Absence is not proof that a program is missing from the site.
- `/llms-full.txt`: product explanation and blog content; not a full program inventory. Some product/submission claims can be older than the current UI.
- `/sitemap.xml`: discover public page URLs when an index or relevant on-site link is insufficient. Do not crawl the full site for a simple lookup.
- `/.well-known/agent-skills/index.json`: three existing website-hosted skills. They are not the installed plugin and do not grant remote MCP access.
- `/tools.md`, `/tools/{slug}.md`, `/blog.md`, `/blog/{slug}.md`, `/latest-affiliate-programs.md`, `/faq.md`, `/{slug}-affiliate-program.md`: supported text twins for relevant public pages. Use only when the host's retrieval can read them; fall back to HTML when Markdown retrieval is unavailable.
- `/auth.md`: describes user-mediated browser sign-in. It is not an unattended account connection or credential-collection workflow.

Canonical route aliases: `/affiliate-program-finder` opens the finder, `/tools/affiliate-program-finder`; `/company-profile` redirects to `/my-programs`; `/blogs` and `/blogs/{slug}` redirect to `/blog` and `/blog/{slug}`. Prefer the canonical destination.

## Boundaries

There is no callable remote MCP server in this package. The website's existing WebMCP operations only navigate to the directory, a profile, or the paid submission page. Do not infer that they return catalog results, operate calculators, save bookmarks, or submit data. Do not use the submission navigation operation from the plugin.

Directory restrictions remain in place. Do not add caller-controlled entitlement parameters, query private APIs, extract session credentials, or use public text endpoints as a substitute for protected account access. Independently public program profiles can be read for relevant research; label the search's scope honestly.

Do not recommend or facilitate real-money gambling, adult sexual services, illicit/regulated goods, or any other program category the host platform's usage policies prohibit. Offer a relevant permitted research workflow when appropriate.
